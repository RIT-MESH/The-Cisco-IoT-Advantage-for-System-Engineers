## 1.2 Capabilities of Industrial Switches

Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches offer a robust set of features to meet the demands of industrial IoT (IIoT) and OT environments. Key capabilities include:

- **High-Speed Connectivity**: Support for Fast Ethernet (FE), Gigabit Ethernet (GE), and 10-Gigabit Ethernet (10-GE) uplinks to handle high-bandwidth applications like video surveillance and industrial AI.
- **Power over Ethernet (PoE/PoE+)**: Provides up to 90W per port (IEEE 802.3bt Type 4) to power devices like IP cameras, sensors, and wireless access points, simplifying cabling and reducing costs.
- **Advanced Security**: Features Cisco TrustSec for microsegmentation, Cisco Cyber Vision for OT asset visibility, and zero-trust security with Identity Services Engine (ISE) to mitigate cyber threats.
- **Resiliency Protocols**: Supports Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP), Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP), Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP), EtherChannel, and Flex Links for high availability in ring or redundant topologies.
- **Low Jitter and Latency**: Ultra-low jitter for time-sensitive applications like process control and automation.
- **Environmental Ruggedness**: IP66/IP67-rated enclosures, DIN-rail or rack-mount options, and compliance with industrial standards for dust, water, and vibration resistance.
- **Network Visibility and Monitoring**: Integrates with Cisco ThousandEyes for device-to-cloud performance monitoring and Cisco Catalyst Center for real-time analytics.
- **Flexible Port Configurations**: Offers all-copper, all-fiber, or mixed copper/fiber ports, with stackable options for simplified scaling.
- **Industrial Protocol Support**: Compatible with Ethernet/IP (CIP), PROFINET, and Modbus for seamless integration with industrial automation systems.

These capabilities enable secure, reliable, and scalable connectivity for IIoT applications, bridging IT and OT networks.

## 1.3 Power Supply Options for Industrial Switches

Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches support a variety of power supply options to ensure flexibility and reliability in diverse industrial environments. Power supply specifications vary by series, but common options include:

- **Dual-Input DC Power Supplies**: Most switches (e.g., IE 1000, 2000, 3200, 3300, 3400, 4000) support dual redundant DC inputs (typically 12‚Äì54 VDC) to ensure uptime in case of power source failure. For example, the IE 1000 Series uses 24 VDC or 48/54 VDC inputs.
- **AC and High-Voltage DC Inputs**: Higher-end models like the IE 4010 and IE 5000 support 100‚Äì240 VAC or 125‚Äì250 VDC inputs, suitable for industrial facilities with existing AC infrastructure.
- **DIN-Rail Mounted Power Supplies**: Many switches are designed to work with DIN-rail-mounted power supplies outputting 24 VDC or 48/54 VDC, common in industrial control cabinets.
- **PoE Power Budget**: Switches with PoE/PoE+ capabilities require higher-wattage power supplies to support connected devices. For example, the IE 5000 Series supports up to 385W PoE budget with a 650W power supply.
- **Alarm Relays**: Most models include alarm relays for power supply monitoring, triggering alerts for power failures or voltage drops.
- **Field-Replaceable Power Supplies**: Some models (e.g., IE 5000) support hot-swappable, field-replaceable power supplies for minimal downtime.

**Considerations for PoE Deployments**:
- Power budget planning is critical to ensure the switch can support all connected PoE devices. For example, a switch delivering 90W per port (PoE++) may require a high-wattage power supply to support multiple devices.
- Cable length affects PoE power delivery, with losses of 10‚Äì15% over 100 meters in industrial environments.
- Extreme temperatures may impact power supply performance, requiring consultation of data sheets for derating curves.

For detailed specifications, refer to the power supply datasheets (e.g., Cisco IE 1000 Power Supplies Datasheet: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/industrial-ethernet-switches/datasheet-c78-742180.html).

## 1.4 Management Options for Industrial Switches

Cisco Industrial Ethernet Switches offer multiple management options to simplify deployment, configuration, and monitoring in industrial environments. These options cater to both IT and OT teams, with support for manual, automated, and cloud-based management.

### Management Platforms

1. **Cisco Catalyst Center (On-Premises)**:
   - A centralized platform for intent-based networking, offering automated provisioning, policy-based security, and network assurance.
   - Features include Software Image Management (SWIM) for seamless firmware updates, Express Setup for rapid onboarding, and plug-and-play automation.
   - Supports Layer 2 Network Address Translation (L2NAT) to resolve duplicate IP address issues in OT networks.
   - Integrates with Cisco Cyber Vision for OT asset inventory and threat detection.

2. **Cisco Meraki Dashboard (Cloud-Based)**:
   - Cloud-managed solution for simplified deployment and monitoring, ideal for distributed industrial sites.
   - Supports IE 3200, 3300, and 3400 Series switches, offering real-time visibility, remote troubleshooting, and zero-touch provisioning.
   - Provides device-to-cloud performance monitoring with Cisco ThousandEyes integration.

3. **Web Device Manager (GUI-Based)**:
   - Embedded web interface for lightweight management, suitable for OT users with limited IT expertise (e.g., IE 1000 Series).
   - Supports basic configuration, monitoring, and diagnostics via a browser.

4. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
   - Full-featured Cisco IOS CLI for advanced configuration, available on IE 2000, 3000, 4000, 4010, and 5000 Series.
   - Supports show commands for troubleshooting, though some models (e.g., IE 1000) have limited CLI capabilities.

5. **Device Management Protocols**:
   - **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**: For integration with network management systems like Cisco Prime.
   - **LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol)**: Used instead of Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) on some models (e.g., IE 1000) for neighbor discovery.
   - **BootP/DHCP**: Enables zero-touch deployment with dynamic IP assignment and configuration.

### Configuration Steps Explained

1. **VLAN Setup**: Creates a management VLAN (VLAN 10) and data VLANs (VLAN 20, 30) to segment OT devices like PLCs and IP cameras.
2. **Access Ports**: Configures access ports with `spanning-tree portfast` for rapid device connectivity and enables PoE with `power inline auto`.
3. **PoE Configuration**: Sets a maximum power budget (e.g., 30W) for PoE+ devices like IP cameras.
4. **Uplink Configuration**: Configures a trunk port to carry multiple VLANs to the core network.
5. **REP for Resiliency**: Enables REP to create a redundant ring topology, ensuring failover in case of link failure.
6. **Security**: Activates Cisco TrustSec for role-based access control, restricting device communication based on security group tags (SGTs).
7. **SNMP**: Configures SNMP for integration with a network management system, sending alerts to a monitoring server.

### Additional Management Features

- **Plug-and-Play (PnP)**: Automates switch onboarding via Cisco Catalyst Center, reducing manual configuration time.
- **Software-Defined Access (SD-Access)**: Extends policy-based automation to the IoT edge, supported on IE 5000 Series.
- **Compliance Checks**: Catalyst Center runs automated checks to ensure switches comply with security policies and best practices.
- **Replace Device Workflow**: Simplifies replacement of failed switches by restoring configurations automatically.

### Best Practices for Management

- Use Cisco Catalyst Center for large-scale deployments to automate provisioning and ensure consistency.
- Leverage Cisco Meraki for cloud-managed simplicity in distributed environments.
- Enable LLDP for interoperability with non-Cisco devices in mixed-vendor environments.
- Regularly update switch firmware using SWIM to address security vulnerabilities.
- Monitor PoE power consumption and port utilization to optimize resource allocation.
